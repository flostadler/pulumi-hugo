As a skeptic of "quick starts" myself, I approach most marketing promises with a measure of cautious excitement. If the great and powerful algorithm, a friend, or a peer brought your attention here now, then I invite you to take this one seriously. Pulumi, with it's full support of many general purpose programming languages, can feel like a hastle to set up even if you are already a seasoned developer, and it can feel even worse if you are new to infrastructure as code and coming from a traditional ops background. Finding that magical easy street to success can be elusive and many tasks done with Pulumi require dedication and creativity, but as you will see here, writing and deploying a new Pulumi IaC program in golang, typescript, python, even dotnet, c# and more can actually be surprisingly easy to do yourself.

Sharing Pulumi with people is a genuine passion found among Pulumians all around the globe but we all know evidence reigns king among engineers who, like any good practitioner, expect proof, and of course a hands on experience is always the best.

If seeing is believing then let's make some magic happen to see how easy getting started can be. Evolving your developer workflow with Pulumi gets even better than just easy, it's remarkably powerful and ready for you to adopt in your daily workflows right away too.

Continue with me for this short "batteries included" DevOps developer experience and see how Pulumi, ESC, and Devcontainers are a cloud ops match made in heaven whether you are developing on remote infrastructures or in the comfort of your own devices. The demo app may be a bit light hearted, but the methods we use to get there are so worth it I guarantee you can come away with something new just by trying it yourself.

Below, we are going to cover a few different topics regarding how to easily get started with Pulumi, including other technologies that pair well with a Pulumi workflow during the development process, and finally conclude with a demo and wrap up to see how all of the pieces together form an intuitive and highly effective combination of tools. The fun part is the building, not the prep!

At just over six months into my personal quest to conquer DevOps and GitOps with Pulumi, I have come across a commonly shared question, most recently brought up during a great customer conversation at AWS re:Invent.

### "What should be inside of a GitOps git repository?"

Pulumi is not just a single tool, but rather a cloud developer ecosystem with tools, SDK packages, and cloud service solutions which together form a complete cloud developer experience.

Many cloud native tools and platforms require a plethora of dependencies and accompanying tooling. Pulumi can feel a bit daunting with it's support of many general purpose programming languages, SDK packages, and cloud providers offering more compelling options than we can hope to conquer in a day.

When it comes to ice cream, sometimes just selecting what flavor to have can be too much. *Any good tech article requires food references right?* Not un-like ice cream, when choosing where to start with cloud automation the symptoms of "choice paralysis" can plague even the most veteran dev and ops professionals.

In the DevOps world, whether you are Paladin, Wizard, or Warlock (*cough* DnD nerds) Pulumi's powerful toolset is both a worthy endeavor to learn, and a rewarding challenge to master. Because freezing, while great for ice cream, is not as satisfying when tackling the next cloud problem.

In true DevOps fassion, the work leading up to this blog post alone included a roller coaster of chronic scope creep, pushing deadlines, learning things that scrapped the planned approach and sent us back to the drawing board.

Have we taken on too much? Has the spirit of the project's ambitions exceeded viable goals? I was teetering on the cliff of uncertainty weighing the risks when in the middle of a demo hacking session with a friend, all of these new tools and and insights came together in a vision that tied the loose ends into a clean, one click to start, batteries included, "Pulumi Developer Workflow". After all, you find the best solutions burried in the details, and the only way to reach them is with determination and digging.

Frankly, 10 days ago, I was doubting the viability of turn key promises. Could these holy grail aspirations be on the rocks? Was the struggle necessary? The struggle was a phoenix moment for this project but the pay off is a more reliable and effective way of work that I was able to instantly adopt as the fundamental hub central to all of my daily developer work (and play!). I am confident there is something for everyone in this particular story.

So what exactly is this workflow? All you have to do is "turn the key" or hit that git clone button and you are a step away from your first  `pulumi up` command. Yep, we're really talking about a zero risk, one push to start workflow.

Without further delay, I could not be more excited to share with you the best way to dive into DevOps cloud engineering yet. So let's get to clicking!

## Cloud Ops: Day 0

Because we're counting like computers, of course we start with zero.

> ## What's in a Day 0?

Day zero is going to be your planning and design phase. Sometimes this includes various stages of research, and other times it is a matter of just getting started with hands on investigation.

For us, we have just a few requirements to get started, and I bet you are already at least half of the way there.

> ## What do we need?

Okay, even the fanciest push to start car still wants a fob in your pocket, so let's cover those bases real quick.

- Web Browser
- Github Account
- 10 minutes (aprox.)

> ## Criteria

Alright, you have internet and a browser. Your prep work is done! Remembering our goal of an all inclusive developer environment, let's recount what we need for our *"Day 0"* . Siri, Alexa, and ChatGPT are great but they cannot help us here just yet, so we're going to do this the "old fashioned way".

Below is an abreviated list of the tools baked into the Pulumi Devcontainer which we will be using.

> ## Commandline Utilities

|      Tool               | Description                      |
|:-----------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| A Programming Language  | The code part of IaC             |
| Pulumi CLI              | Infrastructure as Code Tools     |
| Pulumi ESC              | Secrets and Configuration Store  |
| Kubectl                 | Kubernetes CLI                   |
| Direnv                  | Automated Environment Variables  |
| KinD                    | Local Kubernetes Infrastructure  |
| Github CLI              | Github & Git Repository Binaries |
| curl, jq, act, awk, etc | Other useful tools               |

## Cloud native ... cloud developer environment?

Yes! We are going to develop in the cloud, for the cloud, with the cloud, and for today we will do it all from a web browser. If you are already familiar with Github Codespaces, then you might know what to expect next. If not, you are in for a treat.

Alright, let's jump in and get started by launching a new [Github Codespaces]. (click the button)

  ðŸ‘‡ The button right here ðŸ‘‡
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://bit.ly/pulumi-devcontainer) This button ^ __ ^ yes that is the one, after all why shouldnt you click it?

Did you click the button? It's safe, I promise. If you prefer a more informed approach then follow this [Github Codespaces Link](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) for more detailed info about Codespaces and how it works.

Clicking the 'Open in Github Codespaces' button takes you directly into launching a new codespaces session if you are logged into Github. Otherwise, proceed by logging in and then continue with your dev environment, or navigate directly to the [Pulumi Devcontainer] repo and fork / clone the template repository to launch your own codespaces session with access to more customization options during setup.

[Pulumi Devcontainer]:https://github.com/pulumi/devcontainer

> Note:
> This demonstration is deeply integrated into the Web based Codespaces environment offered by Github. Alternatively, the well known VSCode IDE also supports running Devcontainers with docker allowing you the choice of running [Pulumi Devcontainer](#pulumi-devcontainer) locally, complete with support for Docker-in-docker, and even KinD in Docker as we will see shortly!
>

With a new codespaces session launched, you should see the VSCode IDE in your browser. If you are not already familiar with VSCode, you can learn more about it in the [VSCode Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).

Contratulations! Your developer environment is ready for some Pulumi action.

For our final Day 0 step, we need an idea of what we are going to build with our Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) program.

For this, why dont we deploy a Minecraft server on Kubernetes? It's a fun way to get started with Pulumi, and a great way to show off your cloud skills to friends. Maybe share with your favorite young minecraft gamers and young technology masterminds! DevOps is for everyone! AI, Hyperscale Cloud, Enterprise, On-prem, and even Homelab Operations deserve some DevOps heaven. Pulumi is for anyone on their pilgrimage to CloudOps nirvana.

## Pulumi Developer Day 1

> ### We have an environment! We have a plan! Now we need to write our code ... or do we?

Don't just take my word for it, but it is more than just hype. Here at Pulumi the big brains in Engineering have successfully churned the caffeine to code and just since ChatGPT launched at the end of 2022, engineered and implemented a brilliant chatbot implementation to make learning and using Pulumi just that much easier. Thinking back, just two years ago these results would be nothing short of sci-fi fantasy.

> What can Pulumi AI do?
> Honestly we are only just beginning to discover the possibilities ourselves! You can try it out for yourself in the [Pulumi AI WebUI](https://www.pulumi.com/ai/) or read on if you prefer the convenience of a just an editor and terminal like I do.

To help you along the way, Pulumi's ChatGPT powered custom coding chat bot, Pulumi's "[Pulumi AI](https://www.pulumi.com/ai)" is augmented by our Pulumi Cloud Providers, Docs, and SDKs ready to be your cloud ninja sidekick.

Better experienced than just as been working on some pretty cool AI tools to help developers get started with Pulumi, which brings us to the next step in our journey.

#### Pulumi AI to the rescue!

Pulumi AI is available as a web based tool much like the now familiar ChatGPT console, however it is also built into the `pulumi` cli tool, which means you can chat interactively from the pulumi command line interface, conveniently configured already in your new Codespaces IDE.

Let's try it!

### Step 1. Login to Pulumi Cloud

```bash
# First Login to Pulumi Cloud for a few features we will use in upcoming GitOps content.
pulumi login
```

### Step 2. Create a new program

```bash
# Let's create a new pulumi with the Pulumi CLI
pulumi new
```

### Step 3. YOLO for fun and profit!

Let's go all in on this one and try Pulumi AI. We can always enhance the prompt with additional dialog back and forth during the `pulumi new` chat if it doesn't meet our expectations right away.

It is good to keep in mind that even as advanced as AI is today, the practice is still very much in it's infancy. We can dive into the details of Traditional Ops (Imperative Ops), GitOps (Declarative Ops), and AI Ops (Probability Augmented Ops) in another post, but for now let's just see how close the Pulumi AI can get us.

![Alt text](image-1.png)

Woohoo! We selected the AI option on CLI, let's follow the user prompts and feed the AI a simple prompt of what we want our Pulumi project to create.

Let's try something like this:

```bash
Write a program using pulumi kubernetes helm v3 Release to deploy the itzg/minecraft-server helm chart on Kubernetes, and include a pulumi output to show the helm release status."
```

How did we do? Let's see what the AI came up with.

![pulumi ai](image-2.png)

It's looking pretty good for a simple deployment. We cant get too confident yet but fortune favors the bold so let's proceed in hopes of *good* fortune today. I already ran `kind create cluster` in my Codespaces using the included Devcontainer `docker-outside-of-docker` "feature", so let's start by trying the deployment there to to test. Proceed through the remaining prompts from the `pulumi new` interactive cli and then you can continue to next steps.

![python venv ready to rock and roll](image-3.png)

I chose python for this project, but you can choose any of the supported languages. We can see that `pulumi new` has created a new python virtual environment for us programatically. In addition to the boilerplate to support our new project, Pulumi AI wrote the first iteration of our Python Minecraft Deployment IaC! The next steps are printed on screen. Assuming your kind cluster and kubeconfig are ready to roll we just have one step left.

Hint, this is where we get the name for our annual "[Pulumi Up](https://youtu.be/J5BudoobwgY) confrence.

> **Follow the link for the full playlist of 2023 Pulumi Up sessions**

```bash
pulumi up -y
```

## Pulumi Developer Day 2

And because no hero's journey can be documented without the gruesome account of what came before, I have included many of the manual steps required to reach this state one command at a time.

<details>

### Git Code Repository

Now create a git code repository to version control this project infrastructure code in Github.

```bash
# Authenticate with Github before proceeding.
gh auth login --web --git-protocol https --scopes "repo,gist,read:packages,admin:org,delete_repo,codespace"

# Create new Git Repository
gh repo create workshop --public \
  --gitignore Python --license apache-2.0 \
  --description "pulumi iac developer workflow workshop"

# Initialize the git repository
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/${GITHUB_USER}/workshop .

# Configure `git` cli to use the `gh` cli for authentication with Github
gh auth setup-git

# Configure the username and email associated with your Github account.
git config --global user.email ${GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL}
git config --global user.name ${GITHUB_USER}

# List files being tracked by git and their current status.
git status
```

#### Direnv: Automatic Environment Variables

Various non-secret environment variables may be worth maintaining in code locally as well. There are many ways to do this, but here we are going to use Direnv to automatically load environment variables from a .envrc file.

```bash
# Add environment variables useful during development to .envrc
cat <<EOF >> .envrc
export NO_COLOR=true
export PULUMI_HOME=\${HOME}/.pulumi
export PULUMI_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=true
export PULUMI_SKIP_CONFIRMATIONS=true
export KUBECONFIG=\${PWD}/.kube/config
source venv/bin/activate 2>/dev/null || true
EOF
```

Now you can enable direnv on this directory.

```bash
# Enable direnv in this directory.
direnv allow
```

> Note:
>
> Env variables shown are for educational purposes only and should be used with care.
> Read more about available Pulumi Environment variables here:
> https://www.pulumi.com/docs/cli/environment-variables

#### Pulumi Devcontainer

Now, to make sure we have all of our cli dependencies, let's grab the [Pulumi Devcontainer].

```bash
# Add the Pulumi Devcontainer git submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/pulumi/devcontainer .devcontainer
git submodule update --init --recursive .devcontainer

# Copy the devcontainer config of your choice into the top level of your project
# so it will auto select by default when you open Codespaces in the future.
cp -f .devcontainer/devcontainer.json .devcontainer.json

# Rebuild the codespaces using the newly added Pulumi Devcontainer
gh codespace rebuild --codespace ${CODESPACE_NAME}
```

#### Pulumi Cloud

Let's login to Pulumi Cloud and initialize a new ESC environment to store our environment variables, secrets, and configuration which should be preserved and distributed securely from your Pulumi Cloud account.

```bash
# Login to Pulumi Cloud
pulumi login

# Create a new ESC Environment (optionally use another already existing environment)
pulumi env init workshop
```

#### KinD: Kubernetes-in-docker

We are going to use Kubernetes to demonstrate our Pulumi IaC. Let's go ahead and create a new cluster now.

```bash
# Create the directory for your new kind kubeconfig
mkdir .kube

# Create a Kind Cluster
kind create cluster

# Let's make sure our kubeconfig works and pods are starting up
kubectl get pods -A

# Load Kubeconfig into Pulumi ESC as an encrypted secret for safe keeping.
# This is an example use case for storing kubeconfig which would not usually be practical
# for disposable kind kubernetes clusters like this however the approach is practical in many
# other scenarios which you may come across.
pulumi env set workshop secrets.kubeconfig.kind --secret "$(jq . -R -s < $KUBECONFIG)"
pulumi env set workshop files.KUBECONFIG --plaintext \${secrets.kubeconfig.kind}
```

In our environment, we maintain our secrets including api personal access tokens, kubeconfigs, and such all with Pulumi's Environments, Secrets, and Configuration cloud service.

```bash
# Load the newly updated Pulumi ESC Environment in the local shell
eval $(pulumi env open workshop --format shell)
```

#### Now let's create the deployment code!

If fortune favors the bold, let's be bold on this next step and let AI write our sample code on the fly!

As this is a "hello world" style demonstration intended to showcase the developer workflow more than any specific cloud technologies, let's deploy something fun like a Minecraft server! Be sure to watch for the video demonstration of this exercise on Pulumi's PulumiTV YouTube channel for an extra easter egg bonus step!

```bash
# Write a new Pulumi Python IaC program to deploy Minecraft on Kubernetes
pulumi new \
  --ai "Write a program using pulumi kubernetes helm v3 Release to deploy the itzg/minecraft-server helm chart on Kubernetes, and include a pulumi output to show the helm release status." \
  --description "A pulumi infrastructure as code (iac) program for deploying and serving minecraft on kubernetes" \
  --name "minecraft-on-kubernetes" \
  --language python \
  --stack "workshop" \
  --force \
  --dir .
```

Now let's see if our new Infrastructure as Code Pulumi Python Codebase will deploy!

```bash
# Deploy your new Pulumi IaC on Kubernetes
pulumi stack select workshop
pulumi up
```

#### Conclusion

```bash
# Check for your new Minecraft pod
kubectl get po
```

</details>

#### Cleanup

```bash
pulumi destroy -y --skip-preview
pulumi stack rm workshop
kind delete cluster --name kind
gh repo delete ${GITHUB_USER}/workshop
```
